"A description of the release process might include information about who received access to the model at what stage of the release of the model. For example, a developer might conduct a staged release where it releases the model to a select group at first and subsequently makes the model more widely available. We recognize that the release of a foundation model falls along a spectrum, with many different forms of release, and that different developers may conceptualize release differently. We will award this point for any detailed discussion of the release process, including if the discussion is more general to the developer rather than the specific foundation model under consideration."
"A model access protocol refers to the steps, requirements, and considerations involved in granting authorized model access to external entities. We will award this point if the developer discloses key details of its protocol, including (i) where external entities can request access (e.g. via an access request form); (ii) explicit criteria for selecting external entities; and (iii) a transparent decision on whether access has been granted within a specified, reasonable period of time."

We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what qualifies as an affected individual. We will award this point if there is a meaningful estimate of the number of affected individuals along with a clear description of what it means for an individual to be affected by the model."
"By change log, we mean a description associated with each change to the model (which should be indicated by a change in version number). We recognize that different developers may adopt different practices for change logs that may differ from practices used elsewhere in software engineering. We will award this point if the change log provides a clear description of changes that is legible to a technical audience."
"By deprecation policy, we refer to a description of what it means for a model to be deprecated and how users should respond to the deprecation (e.g. instructions to migrate to a newer version). We will award this point for a clear disclosure of a deprecation policy or if there is no risk of deprication (e.g. if the developer openly releases model weights)."
"By distribution channel, we mean any pathway by which the model is made accessible to entities beyond the developer. We recognize that distribution channels may arise without the knowledge of the model developer. For example, the weights of a model may be released through one distribution channel and then be distributed through other channels. We will award this point if the developer discloses all of the distribution channels of which it is aware."
"By enforcement protocol, we refer to (i) mechanisms for identifying permitted and prohibited users, (ii) mechanisms for identifying permitted/restricted/prohibited uses, (iii) steps the developer takes to enforce its policies related to such uses, and (iv) the developer’s procedures for carrying out these steps. We will award this point for a reasonable best-effort attempt to provide the bulk of this information, though one line indicating the developer reserves the right to terminate accounts is insufficient. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not enforce its usage policy."
"By enforcement protocol, we refer to mechanisms for identifying whether model behavior is permitted or prohibited and actions that may arise in the event the model behavior policy is violated. For example, the developer may make updates to the model in response to issues with the model’s adherence to the model behavior policy. We will award this point if there is a clear description of the enforcement protocol, or if the developer reports that it does not enforce its model behavior policy or that it has no such restrictions on the model’s behavior."
"By feedback mechanism, we refer to a means for external entities to report feedback or issues that arise in relation to the foundation model. Such entities may include but are not necessarily limited to users. We will award this point if the developer discloses a feedback mechanism that has been implemented."
"By market sector, we refer to an identifiable part of the economy. While established standards exist for describing market sectors, we recognize that developers may provide vague or informal characterizations of market impact. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of affected market sectors."
"By model mitigations, we refer to interventions implemented by the developer at the level of the model to reduce the likelihood and/or the severity of the model’s risks. We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for mitigations, or conceptualize mitigations differently. We will award this point for any clear, but potentially incomplete, description of multiple mitigations associated with the model's risks. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not mitigate risk."
"By monitoring mechanism, we refer to a specific protocol for tracking model use that goes beyond an acknowledgement that usage data is collected. We will also award this point for a reasonable best-effort attempt to describe monitoring mechanisms, or if a developer discloses that a distribution channel is not monitored."
"By third parties, we mean entities that are significantly or fully independent of the model developers. In contrast to the third party evaluation indicators for capabilities and risks, we will award this point if third party evaluations are possible even if no third party has yet conducted them. Such evaluations are possible if, for example, the model is deployed via an API (or with open weights) and there are no restrictions on evaluating limitations (e.g. in the usage policy)."
"By third party, we mean entities that are significantly or fully independent of the developer. A third party risk evaluation might involve the developer allowing a third party to choose a methodology for evaluating risks that differs from that of the developer. We will award this point if (i) a third party has conducted an evaluation of model risks, (ii) the results of this evaluation are publicly available, and (iii) these results are disclosed or referred to in the developer’s materials. If the results are not made public (but are disclosed to have been conducted) and/or the results are not discoverable in the developer’s materials, we will not award this point. We may accept a justification from either the third party or the developer for why part of the evaluation is not disclosed in relation to risks."

"By third party, we mean entities that are significantly or fully independent of the model developers. This indicator assesses whether it is possible for third parties to assess mitigations, which is not restricted to the methods the developer uses to assess mitigations. In contrast to the third party evaluation indicators for capabilities and risks, we will award this point if third party evaluations are possible even if no third party has yet conducted them."
"By versioning, we mean that each instance of the model is uniquely identified and that the model is guaranteed to not change when referring to a fixed version number; alternatively, the version clearly indicating a specific instance of the model may be able to change by noting that it is the ""latest"" or an ""unstable"" version. We recognize that different developers may adopt different versioning practices that may differ from standard semantic versioning practices used elsewhere in software engineering."

Therefore, we permit the developer to specify the task and hardware setup, as long as both are clear. For example, the specific task might be generating 100k tokens as 5k sequences of length 20 and the fixed set of hardware might be 8 NVIDIA A100s. The hardware in this evaluation need not be the hardware the developer uses for inference if it in fact does any inference itself."

"Rigorous evaluations refer to precise quantifications of the model's behavior in relation to its capabilities. We recognize that capabilities may not perfectly align with evaluations, and that different developers may associate capabilities with evaluations differently. We will award this point for clear evaluations of multiple capabilities. For example, this may include evaluations of world knowledge, reasoning, state tracking or other such proficiencies. Or it may include the measurement of average performance (e.g. accuracy, F1) on benchmarks for specific tasks (e.g. text summarization, image captioning). We note that evaluations on standard broad-coverage benchmarks are likely to suffice for this indicator, though they may not if the model's capabilities are presented as especially unusual such that standard evaluations will not suffice."
"Rigorous evaluations refer to precise quantifications of the model's behavior in relation to its trustworthiness. For example, this may include evaluations of the model’s robustness or reliability, its uncertainty, calibration, or causality, or its interpretability or explainability. We recognize that trustworthiness may not perfectly align with evaluations, and that different developers may associate trustworthiness with evaluations differently. We will award this point for a clear evaluation of the trustworthiness of the model."
"Rigorous evaluations refer to precise quantifications of the model's behavior in relation to such risks. Intentional harms include fraud, disinformation, scams, cybersecurity attacks, designing weapons or pathogens, and uses of the model for illegal purposes. We recognize that unintentional harms may not perfectly align with risk evaluations, and that different developers may associate risks with evaluations differently. We will award this point for clear evaluations of multiple such risks. We note that evaluations on standard broad-coverage benchmarks are likely to suffice for this indicator, though they may not if the model's risks related to unintentional harm are presented as especially unusual or severe."

"Such documentation might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly."
"Such government inquiries might include requests for user data, requests that certain content be banned, or requests for information about a developer’s business practices. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required for such a summary of government inquiries.

"Such harmful content might relate to violence or child sexual abuse material. We will award this point if the developer reports that it does not perform any harmful data filtration."
"Such restrictions may relate to countries (e.g. US-only), organizations (e.g. no competitors), industries (e.g. no weapons industry users) or other relevant factors. These restrictions on users are often contained in multiple policies; we group them here for simplicity. We will awarded this point for a clear description of permitted, restricted, and prohibited users of the model."
"Such steps might include augmenting data sources with synthetic data. We will award this point if the developer reports that it does not take any steps to augment its data."

"The continuous duration of time required to build the model should be reported in weeks, days, or hours to a precision of one significant figure (e.g. 3 weeks). No form of decomposition into phases of building the model is required for this indicator, but it should be clear what the duration refers to (e.g. training the model, training and subsequent evaluation and red teaming)."
"The duration should be reported in seconds to a precision of one significant figure (e.g. 0.002 seconds). We recognize that no established standard exists for the standardized reporting of inference evaluation. Therefore, we permit the developer to specify the task and hardware setup, as long as both are disclosed. The hardware in this evaluation need not be the hardware the developer uses for inference if it in fact does any inference itself. For example, the specific task might be generating 100,000 tokens as 5,000 sequences of length 20 and the fixed set of hardware might be 8 NVIDIA A100s. The hardware in this evaluation need not be the hardware the developer uses for inference if it in fact does any inference itself."

"This indicator is inclusive of data labor at all points of the model development process, such as training data annotation or red teaming data used to control the model. It is also inclusive of all data that is created by or on behalf of the developer. As an example, labor protections might include protocols to reduce the harm to workers' mental health stemming from exposure to violent content when annotating training data. We will award this point if the developer reports that it does not protect workers or if it does not use data laborers and therefore has no labor protections."
"This indicator is inclusive of data labor at all points of the model development process, such as training data annotation or red teaming data used to control the model.

"We recognize that a developer may provide many products and services that depend on a foundation model or internal derivatives of the model. We will award this point for a reasonable best-effort description of any ways the developer makes internal use of the model in its products or services."
"We recognize that different developers may share this information through different types of documentation, such as a system card or several clearly interrelated documents. We will award this point for the disclosure of any such centralized artifact that provides key information typically included in a model card, though the artifact may be longer-form than a standard model card (e.g. a technical report)."
"We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for these stages, or conceptualize the stages differently. We will award this point if there is a clear description of the update to the model related to each stage, whether that is the intent of the stage (e.g. making the model less harmful), a mechanistic characterization (e.g. minimizing a specific loss function), or an empirical assessment (e.g. evaluation results conducted before and after the stage)."
"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a feedback report. For this reason, we will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of feedback received."
"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a usage report. Usage statistics might include, for example, a description of the major categories of harm that has been caused by use of the model. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of usage statistics."
"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what qualifies as an application. We will award this point if there is a meaningful estimate of the number of downstream applications, along with some description of what it means for an application to be dependent on the model."
"We refer to a policy that includes this information as a model behavior policy, or a developer's policy on what the foundation model can and cannot do (e.g. such a policy may prohibit a model from generating child sexual abuse material). We recognize that different developers may adopt different business models and that some business models may make enforcement of a model behavior policy more or less feasible. We will award this point if at least two of the three categories (i.e. permitted, restricted, and prohibited model behaviors) are disclosed. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not impose any restrictions on its model's behavior."
"We will also award this point if the developer reports it does not have any such redress mechanism."
"We will also award this point if the developer reports that it has no user data protection policy."
"We will award this point for any reasonable mechanism for providing access: direct access to the data, an interface to query the data, a developer-mediated access program where developers can inspect requests, etc. Developers may receive this point even if there are rate-limits on the number of queries permitted to an external entity and restrictions on which external entities are given access, insofar as these limits and restrictions are transparent and ensure a reasonable amount of external access. We may accept justifications for prohibiting queries of specific parts of the data."
"We will award this point if at least two of the following three categories are disclosed: (i) permitted uses, (ii) restricted uses, and (iii) prohibited uses. By restricted uses, we mean uses that require a higher level of scrutiny (such as permission from or a separate contract with the developer) to be permitted. These uses are generally included in an acceptable use policy, model license, or usage policy."
"We will award this point if external entities can directly access the data without any form of gating from the developer. With that said, we may award this point if the developer provides justifications for prohibiting access to specific parts of the data or to unauthorized external entities."
"We will award this point if the developer provides a usage policy violation appeals mechanism, regardless of whether it is provided via a user interface or distribution channel."

"While information about data creators may not be easily discernible for some data scraped from the web, the general sources (URLs/domains) should be listed, and, for other data that is bought, licensed, or collected, a reasonable attempt at characterizing the underlying people who provided the data is required to receive this point. The relevant properties of people can vary depending on context: for example, relevant properties could include demographic information like fraction of Black individuals contributing to the dataset, geographic information like fraction of European individuals contributing to the dataset, language information like fraction of L1 English speakers, or occupational information like the fraction of professional artists."
"While the most direct environmental impact of building a foundation model is the energy used and, therefore, the potential carbon emissions, there may be other environmental impacts. For example, these may include the use of other resources such as water for cooling data centers or metals for producing specialized hardware. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus list of broader environmental factors. For this reason, we will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially incomplete, discussion of broader environmental impact."
